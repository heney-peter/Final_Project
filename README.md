# Final_Project
This project explores the benefits of the two main ski passes - Epic and Ikon - by allowing people to see which resorts they can access and the quality of these resorts.
This is done with an interactive map showing location and summary info of all resorts on the two passes, as well as a filterable graph for historic snow data at each resort.
